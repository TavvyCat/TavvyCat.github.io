  jobDescription: 'I am Tavish Cary. I am a software developer with a background in philosophy. While I have no formal education in philosophy, I’ve spent the better part of the last 8 years figuring out the world and how it works. This includes theology, politics, ethics, economics, sociology, and everything in between. This has made me good at figuring out complex problems. One change in logic can create a cascade of changes down the line. I’m good at seeing the flaws in certain ways of thinking and will bring that into my software development career.',
